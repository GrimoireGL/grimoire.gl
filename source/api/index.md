# API references are currently under moving

We would make all API references be auto generated.
All the other pages in this category is deprecated except the link below.

* [Core library API Reference](http://api.grimoire.gl/core/)
* [Renderer library API Reference](http://api.grimoire.gl/grimoirejs-fundamental/)
* [Math library API Reference](http://api.grimoire.gl/grimoirejs-math/)

As our tutorial saying, our library is group of plugins. Even the WebGL stuff is plugin.
Therefore, each repository and documentation is currently separated for each.
We know this is very inconvenience. We would work this problem as soon as possible to enable users to search APIs easily.
