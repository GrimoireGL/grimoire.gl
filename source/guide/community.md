The Grimoire.js project is growing day by day. In the past it was until the point where some people will cooperate from the project that I have been making alone.

You are also reading this page, you are ready to join the community. I will show you what the community can do for you and what you can do for the community on this page.

First of all, ** Welcome. To the community of Grimoire.js **

# Communication tool

Whether you first get cooperation or not, the story will not start unless you join the community in some way, even if you can cooperate.

## slack

We use Slack to discuss `Grimoire.js` on a daily basis. Perhaps the features that you want now are probably being discussed here.
The content you are suffering now may be the contents that other people are suffering right now. Let's start by participating first.

** Easy registration from the following link **

## Github

If you are suffering from bugs or have questions on the source code, you should see Github.
Do not hesitate to throw Issue or Pull request. Anyone who follows that step is one of the important communities for `Grimoire.js`.

https://github.com/GrimoireGL/GrimoireJS

If you do not know whether the bug is a core bug or a bug, please write it in the Issue of the core. If you are sure which plugin bug is clear, please go to the Issue of the target repository from the following page.

# What the community can do

# Obtain support

If you hear it in Slack or Issue, there may be content that you can solve for what you are suffering now.

Sometimes it may be a bug. In that case, your support will be a big plus for the community.

# What the community can do

## Bug report, pull request

Bug reporting is a very much appreciated contribution method. Your notice may not be aware of members of communities that have been using for a long time.

Please be sure to tell from [Github](https://github.com/GrimoireGL/GrimoireJS). Tomorrow's stability will come from your bug report.

## Translation of documents

In Grimoire.js, the documents on the official website except Github are written in Japanese as of now.
However, this should eventually be in English and the current situation is this way as a compromise between core team development speed and document maintenance.

In this project, we are looking for someone who can cooperate in translating documents. Those who can cooperate with OSS from Japan flapping abroad please cooperate.
(In this case, sorry to trouble you, but please enter slack first.)

We are now looking for translators! Currently our documents are written in Japanese except some documents on Github.
But we really want to translate all our documents in English.

If you are interested in our team, please join our slack by the link above.
